# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#The first thing I wanted to do was calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotifydate table.
Then for every artists with a popularity with 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a 'Top Star'
I used the following SQL to do that.

WITH popu_avg AS (
SELECT Spotifydata.artist_name,
AVG(Spotifydata.popularity) AS avg_popu
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY Spotifydata.artist_name)

SELECT artist_name,avg_popu,'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popu_avg
WHERE avg_popu >= 90
